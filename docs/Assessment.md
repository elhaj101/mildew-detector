LO1 - Develop an understanding of the fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning (ML) and Data Science.
Criterion	Meets Criterion	Reason
1.1	Yes	The Business requirements are articulated with a clear background of the business problem along with objective dataset content descriptions (preferably tabular)
Additional		The project uses fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning (ML) and Data Science to distinguish leafs that contain mildews from normal leafs. The README file contains sections to describe the dataset content and states the two business requirements. The README mentions the number of images in the database. However, one small addition can be mentioning the following details specifically in the README : 1)Are the images uniformed or not? 2)What is the ratio of train/validation/test set sizes? etc.
2.1 Map the business requirements in a User Story based format to each of the Data Visualization and ML Tasks along with the specific actions required for the enablement of each task:
Criterion	Meets Criterion	Reason
2.1	No	Absence of objective Business requirement categorization into Data Visualization and Machine Learning tasks with the associated user stories NOT in the specified Format
2.2	No	There is NO evidence of any ML task being mentioned in the “Rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualizations and ML tasks” section in the README file
Additional		The project is incomplete. For further developments, it is advisable to categorize each business requirement into Data Visualization and Machine Learning tasks with the associated user stories in the specified Format along with the use of Agile techniques and/or tools to map the user stories.
LO3 - Identify and apply authorisation, authentication and permission features in a Full-Stack web application solution:
Criterion	Meets Criterion	Reason
3.1	No	Suboptimal/Missing Data Analysis and/or Visualization.
3.2	No	No clear explanation was provided for the business case goals. ML methods not properly implemented and outcomes obtained are not well documented.
3.3	Yes	Git is used consistently but commit messages can be more descriptive
Additional		The project is incomplete. For further developments, it is advisable to implement data analyse and visualization for the dataset by using plotting methodologies.
LO4 - Obtain actionable insights using Data Analysis and manipulation:
Criterion	Meets Criterion	Reason
4.1	No	Absence of objective conclusive proof that the data anlysis supports or rebuffs the hypotheses made initially
4.2	No	No Objective conclusions can be drawn with the data from the analysis not clearly supporting the success/failure of the model/pipeline
Additional		The project is incomplete. The prediction page is missing a model.
LO5 - Create intelligent systems using Machine Learning:
Criterion	Meets Criterion	Reason
5.1	Yes	Judicious use of Jupyter Notebooks with clear functional connectivity to the app
5.2	Yes	A Jupyter Notebook should be used for each major Analysis task with clear subtext of the activities being performed
5.3	Yes	Correct Deployment Setup for cloud hosting present
5.4	Yes	Dashboards clearly implemented using Streamlit
5.5	Yes	There is a clear articulation at the top of all Jupyter Notebooks, that describe the Objectives/Inputs/Outputs.
5.6	Yes	“app_pages” and “src” folders are implemented to manage the dashboard pages for the application and other auxiliary tasks.
Additional		The modelling notebook helps to answer the business requirement of prediction of the cheery leaf disease. The notebook contains tasks to define the ML pipeline steps, fit the pipeline using early stopping. Moreover, the notebook contains a task to augment the image ImageDataGenerator) and to load images from folder to memory. However, the dashboard is missing these details.
LO6 - Represent data stories via Data Visualization.:
Criterion	Meets Criterion	Reason
6.1	Yes	Contents of each app page are clearly laid out with necessary subtext and explanations for all pages
6.2	No	No plots
6.3	Yes	A clear main menu present with all relevant pages incorporated
Additional		The project is incomplete; the dashboard pages lack essential elements such as plots and a trained prediction model.
LO7 - Collect, arrange and process data from one or more data sources:
Criterion	Meets Criterion	Reason
7.1	Yes	Clear data collection mechanism implemented in Jupyter Notebooks
Additional		Clear data collection mechanism implemented in Jupyter Notebooks
You have received the following textual feedback from the assessor for Merit Criteria to give you an idea of what parts of the project were done particularly well.

Merit Criteria Comments:
Criterion	Meets Criterion	Reason
1.2	No	Suboptimal articulation of project hypotheses with inadequate validation processes for support.
2.3	No	Lack of statistical evidence in the app/Readme to demonstrate that the hypotheses postulated as a part of the Business Requirements have been successfully met
4.3	No	The conclusions drawn need more objective evidence to prove their validity.
5.7	No	Suboptimal of no clear demonstration of hyperparameter tuning along with model evolution present.
6.4	No	
6.5	No	Interactive plot not implemented in the Streamlit app
7.2	Yes	Data cleaning and missing data imputation performed as per the business requirements
Additional		Many of the issues noted earlier will result in the requisite merit criteria not being met here
