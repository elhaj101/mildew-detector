Project Idea 1: Mildew Detection in Cherry Leaves
Marianne McGuineys, a fictional individual, is the head of IT and Innovation at Farmy & Foods, a company in the agricultural sector that produces and harvests different types of food. Recently, she is facing a challenge where their cherry plantations have been presenting powdery mildew, which is a fungal disease that affects a wide range of plants.

The cherry plantation crop is one of their finest products in the portfolio and the company is concerned about supplying the market with a product of compromised quality.

Currently, the process is to manually verify if a given cherry tree contains powdery mildew. An employee spends around 30 minutes in each tree, taking a few samples of tree leaves and verifying visually if the leaf tree is healthy or has powdery mildew. If it has powdery mildew, the employee applies a specific compound to kill the fungus. The time spent applying this compound is 1 minute. The company has thousands of cherry trees located in multiple farms across the country. As a result, this manual process is not scalable due to time spent in the manual process inspection.

To save time in this process, the IT team suggested an ML system that is capable of detecting instantly, using a tree leaf image, if it is healthy or has powdery mildew. A similar manual process is in place for other crops for detecting pests, and if this initiative is successful, there is a realistic chance to replicate this project to all other crops. The dataset is a collection of cherry leaf images provided by Farmy & Foods, taken from their crops.

You will build a dashboard to detect if a cherry leaf is healthy or has powdery mildew. The business requirements are:

The client is interested in conducting a study to visually differentiate a cherry leaf that is healthy from one that contains powdery mildew.
The client is interested in predicting if a cherry tree is healthy or contains powdery mildew.
Deliver a dashboard that meets the above requirements.
